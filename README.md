## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Results of the lingear regression model tests are as follows:

These results provide insight to the following questions:

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

   The two variables/coefficients that provide non-random amount of variance are **vehicle_length** & **ground_clearance**. Thus, vehicle length & ground clearance have a significant impact on Miles Per Gallon test results for the protoype MechaCars.

2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

   No, we have identified a negative linear correlation among certain variables such as **vehicle length** & **ground clearance**. As the length of the vechile increases the miles per gallon test results decrease. Similar to the vehicle length variable, as ground clearance increases miles per gallon test results decrease.

3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

   Yes, this linear model effectively predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes. The r-squard value is **.71**, this metric represents a high probability that the likelihood of future data points will fit this linear model.
